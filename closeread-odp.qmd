Hello World! Please read my Closeread story below.


ideas:

- simple-high-level diagram of modeled-data to codebase + process 
control to data products to odp (and to powerbi from the products)

- keep it simple, focus on the highlights

- pros and cons?

- use a vertical slice as an example - use real-fake data from the 
ODP itself
  
  - diagram of fact surrounded by dims
  - then move fake data, show process control example
  - show a quick snippet of a wrangle
  - mention basic idea of project setup + deployment
    - open source strata + private internal odp pkg +
    http to api with RSocrata
    - wrapped up in renv + keyring for secrets
